### Fire Ball Time

Golden State Warriors's offense fire is not only powerful, but also stable and constant. Put eyes on the shooting made in every minute, when the Death Lineup were on the court, they could provide power.
In the first quarter, they could always score, especially in the middle time, and it goes lower in the tail, which is explainable since all five players but Andre Iguodala are first team, and with switch in the tail period, they scored less. In the second period, as the second team are in and only Andre Iguodala on the court, the shot they made drops steeply.
When the second half begins, which is when Steve Kerr put on the Death Lineup team, the five allstars usually begin their show. They scored in and out, shooting and breaking through, always play an offensive wave to establish lead and expand the points difference. And in the end quarter, they scored less as time goes by, which is always thanks to their dominant performance in the third quarter and get off work.
Clearly, when the Death Lineup are on the court in the third quarter, they could always play fire rounds and score a lot and win the game in the end. That's the magic of chemistry of the Death Lineup, and of Steve Kerr, of Golden State Warriors.

If that occurs, they will be another dynasty team after Boston Celtics, Los Anglas Lakers, San Antonio Spurs and Chicago Bulls in the history of NBA. Assuming Golden State Warriors could keep the team players and keep healthy, the future of Golden State Warriors must be brilliant and unbeatable. How far could all star Golden State Warriors go?
